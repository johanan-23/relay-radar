# RelayRadar: Acoustic Noise Identification for Hall Microphones

RelayRadar is a Python project designed to enhance audio quality in hall environments by identifying and mitigating unwanted noise generated by monitors. Whether you're dealing with conference halls, auditoriums, or lecture rooms, RelayRadar has you covered. Our goal is to pinpoint and suppress noise sources, ensuring clear and focused audio recordings.

## Key Features:
- **Noise Detection:** Analyze microphone input to identify noise patterns associated with monitors or other sources.
- **Threshold-Based Filtering:** Set customizable thresholds to distinguish between desired audio (speech, music) and unwanted noise.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Implement RelayRadar as a real-time filter for live audio streams during events.

Join us in creating a quieter, more focused auditory experience for hall attendees! 🎙️🔇
